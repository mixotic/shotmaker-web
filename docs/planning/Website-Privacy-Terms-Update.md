# Website Privacy Policy & Terms of Use Update

**Date: February 16, 2026**
**Reason: Apple App Review rejection — Guidelines 5.1.1(i) and 5.1.2(i)**

Apple requires explicit disclosure of what data is sent to third-party AI services, who it's sent to, and that users consent before data is shared. The privacy policy must also confirm the third party provides adequate data protection.

The app's bundled copies of these documents have already been updated. The website versions at `shotmaker.app/privacy` and `shotmaker.app/terms` need to match.

## 1. Privacy Policy (shotmaker.app/privacy)

### Change the "Last Updated" date

From: `January 19, 2026`
To: `February 16, 2026`

### Replace the "Third-Party Services" section

Delete the old section that reads:

> ## Third-Party Services
>
> When you use ShotMaker to generate images or videos, data is sent to Google's Generative AI APIs (Gemini and Veo). This occurs only when you explicitly request content generation.
>
> **Data sent to Google includes:**
> - Text prompts you provide
> - Reference images you upload (if applicable)
> - Generation parameters (aspect ratio, style settings, etc.)
>
> **This data is subject to Google's privacy policies:**
> - Google Privacy Policy
> - Google AI Terms of Service
>
> We have no control over how Google processes this data. Please review Google's policies to understand their data practices.

Replace it with:

> ## Third-Party AI Services — Data Sharing with Google
>
> ShotMaker uses Google LLC's Generative AI APIs to provide image and video generation features. **Data is only sent to Google when you explicitly initiate content generation** (e.g., by clicking a "Generate" button). No data is sent in the background or without your action.
>

>
> No data is sent to any other third party. ShotMaker does not operate its own servers and does not relay, store, or retain any of your data.
>
